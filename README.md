# Main() Entry Point to Software Engineering

:speaker: This project is created to be my main entry point to **software engineering world** :globe_with_meridians:

    dar920910.Main() => "Hello, Software Engineering World!"

## About This Repository

:notebook: The main reason for creating this repository is to **centralize** all important information explored by me for last several years (*instead of keeping it in web browser bookmarks and Evernote notebooks*).

:question: The repository can be useful resource if you're going to:

- Prepare roadmaps for learning aims
- Keep all needed info in the one place
- Share useful IT resources

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Creating this repository, I'm looking for more **convenient/flexible** experience to support my IT resources library for future years.
